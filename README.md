# sysfuck.exe
a smol xp malware i made
# requirements
a virtualbox vm with the guest additions and .net 4 runtime installed, windows xp as the os of the vm might be optional but recommended
# note
i am not responsible for anything done with the executable and the source code
# for devs
crediting me and making the malware you made open source is optional, but would be nice if you did that
