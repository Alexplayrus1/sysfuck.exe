# sysfuck.exe
a smol xp malware i made in c#
# requirements
a virtualbox vm with the guest additions and .net 4 runtime installed, windows xp as the os of the vm might be optional but recommended
# note
i am not responsible for anything done with the executable and the source code
# for devs
crediting me and making the malware you made open source is optional, but would be nice if you did that
# bugs
the vm still can start up once the malware has took its effect, i dont know if its virtualbox or win xp self-repairing the vm and idk how to fix that, the timer for the restart is delayed and i also dont know how can i fix that
